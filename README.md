# MurLigase
This website contains everything to do with the Mur Ligase Project, which is an open source drug discovery project. The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, through inhibition of the Mur ligase enzymes.

To Do List: click on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase/issues), above.

Some intro reading: [blog post on Practical Fragments](http://practicalfragments.blogspot.com/2019/04/help-develop-new-antibiotics-from.html).

This is an "open source" project, meaning everything is shared and you can be involved as a full participant. For a brief outline of what this means, take a look at [this "about" page over at Open Source Malaria](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/About-StartHere-FAQ) or read [this paper describing some of the general rules](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmdc.201900565).

All OSA molecules can be seen in the [Master List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/168-a1_l51Nfbms67eG8zU8p-EhEtEO26FUzRInbu7fY/edit?usp=sharing). There is a [compound numbering system](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/OSA_Tech_Ops/wiki/Molecule-Numbering-Convention) for OSA.
